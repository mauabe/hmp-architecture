You donâ€™t have to use all the projects I sent you. Whatever looks the best but I sent you a variety. They are mostly old since I havenâ€™t been taking photos of my current jobs. I feel odd posting someoneâ€™s home publicly. Maybe not mention the last names of the residential jobs.
 
Stats: Born and raised in Helsinki, Finland where finished high-school, Graduated from Univ. of Hawaii 1995. Studied one year at SCI-ARC, Los Angeles. Obtained CA architectâ€™s license 2000. Carry omissions and errors policy.
I do small commercial and any size residential projects. I have assistants who help me with as-builts and drafting, and structural engineers I work with.
I do all residential services for City of Los Angeles Building and Safety: Green, LID, Title-24; the full complicated permit process. And all surrounding cities from Santa Barbara & Kern Counties to Orange and Riverside Counties.
 
I need to set up a new email address thru this hosting; Heidi@....
I donâ€™t want my home/office address in the site; only located in Rancho Palos Verdes, CA overlooking the Los Angeles Harbor. Phone 310-770-2791.
 
Ask me anything else ðŸ˜Š
 
Thanks!
